## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Cross-repo impact analysis** — `@repo` MCP routing plus group resources let impact queries span multiple indexed repositories in a group (#794, #984)
- **Python scope-based call resolution** — registry-primary flip, performance, and generalization work from RFC #909 Ring 3 (#980)
- **C# scope-resolution migration** — C# now runs on the registry-primary path alongside Python (#934, #1019)
- **RFC #909 Ring 1 & Ring 2 scope-resolution infrastructure** — the shared foundation for language-agnostic scope resolution:
  - Scope-resolution types and constants, `LanguageProvider` hook extension (#910, #911, #949, #950)
  - `ScopeTree` + `PositionIndex` + `makeScopeId` (#912, #961)
  - `DefIndex` / `ModuleScopeIndex` / `QualifiedNameIndex` (#913, #958)
  - `MethodDispatchIndex` materialized view over `HeritageMap` (#914, #960)
  - `resolveTypeRef` strict single-return type resolver (#916, #959)
  - SCC-aware finalize with bounded fixpoint (#915, #962)
  - `ClassRegistry` / `MethodRegistry` / `FieldRegistry` + 7-step lookup (#917, #963)
  - Shadow-mode diff + aggregate, parity harness + static dashboard (#918, #923, #951, #972)
  - `ScopeExtractor` driver with 5-pass CaptureMatch → ParsedFile (#919, #965)
  - `ScopeExtractor` wired into parse-worker + processor (#920, #969)
  - `finalize-orchestrator` materializes `ScopeResolutionIndexes` (#921, #970)
  - Per-language `resolveImportTarget` adapter (#922, #971)
  - `REGISTRY_PRIMARY_<LANG>` per-language flag reader (#924, #968)
  - `emit-references` drains `ReferenceIndex` to graph edges (#925, #973)
- **`gitnexus analyze --name <alias>`** with duplicate-name guard in the repo registry (#955)
- **`gitnexus remove <target>`** unindexes a registered repo by name or path (#664, #1003)
- **Auto-infer registry name** from `git remote.origin.url` when `--name` is omitted (#981)
- **Sibling-clone drift detection** — indexed repos are fingerprinted by remote URL so duplicate registrations are caught before graph divergence (#982)
- **Configurable large-file skip threshold** — the walker's 512 KB default is now overridable via `GITNEXUS_MAX_FILE_SIZE` (KB) or `gitnexus analyze --max-file-size <kb>`. Values are clamped to the 32 MB tree-sitter ceiling, invalid inputs fall back to the default with a one-time warning, and the CLI banner reports the effective post-clamp threshold when an override is active (#991, #1044, #1045)
- **`GITNEXUS_INDEX_TEST_DIRS` opt-in** for `__tests__` / `__mocks__` traversal (#771, #1046)
- **`analyze` embedding preservation** — existing embeddings are preserved by default, `--force` regenerates them, `--drop-embeddings` opts out entirely (CLI + HTTP API) (#1055)
- **Structural embedding chunking** with data-driven `CHUNKING_RULES` dispatch, replacing the flat line-based split (#987)
- **PHP HTTP consumer detection** for the extractor catalogue (#993)
- **Per-phase search timing** instrumentation across the query pipeline (#953)
- **MCP disambiguation ranking** — `context` / `impact` candidates are ranked and expose `kind` / `file_path` hints (#888)
- **Docker images for UI + CLI/server** shipped via `docker-compose` with cosign signing (#967), RC image builds (#978), and GHCR → Docker Hub mirroring (#1029)

### Fixed

- **Go CALLS edges for receiver methods** — worker source IDs now align with the main pipeline, restoring receiver-method call edges (#1043)
- **Node 22 DEP0151 warning** from `tree-sitter-c-sharp` import silenced (#1013, #1049)
- **FTS index bootstrap** tries a local `LOAD` before `INSTALL` so offline/air-gapped runs no longer fail on network errors (#726)
- **FTS ensure failures** are no longer cached and are invalidated on pool teardown (#1006)
- **`groupImpact` local-impact errors** now bubble to the caller instead of being swallowed (#1004, #1007)
- **Friendly error** when a group name is not found, with regression test for #903 (#989)
- **`bm25` results** return FTS-matched symbols instead of an arbitrary `LIMIT 3` slice (#806)
- **Embedding AST traversal** switched from recursion to iterative DFS, fixing stack overflow on deeply nested files (#990)
- **React component path detection** runs before lowercasing, so mixed-case `.jsx`/`.tsx` files are recognised (#260)
- **`detect-changes` ENOBUFS** by setting `maxBuffer` on `git` / `rg` `execFileSync` invocations (#957)
- **`detect-changes` in direct CLI** — command was wired to MCP only; now exposed on the CLI as well (#892)
- **CLI gitnexus markers** — `<!-- gitnexus:* -->` is only matched at section position, no longer inside code/prose (#1041, #1042)
- **`opencode.json` setup** preserves existing comments and config during install (#998)
- **Sequential parser logging** — skipped languages are now logged instead of silently dropped (#1021)
- **`cli-e2e` fixture isolation** from the shared mini-repo, plus stabilised `rel-csv-split` stream teardown on Windows via `expect.poll` (#954, #1052)
- **Docker** — RC build guarded against empty `vtag`, `inputs.tag` used to detect `workflow_call` context, web builder stage now copies `gitnexus/package.json`, base image switched from alpine to debian (#983, #996, #997, #1014)
- **CI** — reusable `docker.yml` now inherits secrets from `release-candidate.yml` (#1054)

### Changed

- **`setup` config I/O unified** on `mergeJsoncFile` across all writers (#1031)
- **Docker CI** gains a retry wrapper for `build-push` with visibility and hardened shell

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Docker support** — containerized ingestion and MCP serving for reproducible runs on CI and container platforms (#848)
- **Language-agnostic heritage extractor** — config+factory pattern for class-heritage extraction (EXTENDS / IMPLEMENTS), completing the extractor refactor alongside method/field/call/variable (#890)
- **Language-agnostic call extractor** — config+factory pattern that collapses ~225 lines of inline parse-worker logic into declarative per-language configs (#877)
- **Language-agnostic variable extractor** — structured metadata for `Const` / `Static` / `Variable` nodes via config+factory pattern (#878)
- **AST-aware embedding chunking** — offset-based splitting preserves symbol boundaries, improving semantic search precision on large files (#889)
- **HTTP consumer detection for jQuery and axios object-form** — `$.ajax` / `$.get` / `$.post` and `axios({ url, method })` now recognized as HTTP call sites (#887)

### Fixed

- **Python external dotted imports** — avoid spurious same-file matches when an import path like `foo.bar.baz` refers to a third-party module (#899)
- **Worker warnings no longer terminate ingestion** — non-fatal parser warnings keep the pipeline running instead of aborting the run (#900, #261)
- **Global-install upgrade `ENOTEMPTY`** — devendored `tree-sitter-proto` install lifecycle + preinstall cleanup so `npm i -g gitnexus@latest` succeeds on top of an older install (#843, #846)
- **`env.cacheDir`** now defaults to a user-writable location, unblocking ingestion on systems where the install directory is read-only (#845)
- **Content-hash staleness detection for embeddings** — zero-node rebuilds no longer skip vector-index creation, fixing semantic search after selective re-analysis (#831)
- **`tree-sitter-c-sharp` version pin** — locked to 0.23.1 to avoid a breaking change in a transitive prerelease (#834)
- **`release-drafter` v7 CI** — replaced the removed `disable-releaser` flag with `dry-run` so release-note drafts still work
- **`npm arborist` crash from `tree-sitter-dart`** — switched the dependency URL format so `npm install` no longer crashes on clean installs
- **Service-group `ManifestExtractor`** — `config.links` now wires the manifest extractor properly, restoring cross-link discovery that had silently dropped to zero

### Changed

- **SemanticModel wired as a first-class resolution input (SM-20)** — `call-processor`, `resolution-context`, `type-env`, and `heritage-map` now consult `table.model.*` directly; 37 internal call sites migrated off the SymbolTable wrapper (#885)
- **Per-strategy `ImportSemantics` hooks** — `named` / `wildcard-transitive` / `wildcard-leaf` / `namespace` strategies split into composable hooks, replacing the monolithic conditional (Strategies 1–4 of #886)
- **Class extraction configs moved to `configs/` subdirectory** — per-language class configs now co-locate with the other extractor configs, completing the extractor layer's directory convention (#879)
- **CLI AI-context trimmed** — duplicated CLAUDE.md block removed from the shipped context, reducing token usage in LLM-consuming workflows (#904)
- **LLM context files optimized** — AI-consumed documentation tuned for accuracy and token efficiency (#857)
- **Workflow concurrency standardized** — all CI workflows adopt the consistent concurrency key pattern documented in CONTRIBUTING.md; release-note labeling automated (#837)
- **E2E status-ready timeout raised** — 45s accommodates parallel-worker startup variance on CI (#908)

### Chore / Dependencies

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Service group extractor expansion** — manifest extractor and broader extractor coverage (2/4 of #606 split) (#796)
- **Dart call patterns** for `await`, cascade, lambda, and widget-tree contexts (#801)

### Fixed

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **TypeScript/JavaScript MethodExtractor** config (#588)

### Fixed
- **Wiki Azure OpenAI** compat and HTML viewer script injection (#618)

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **`gitnexus-shared` module not found** — `gitnexus-shared` was a `file:` workspace dependency never published to npm, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when installing `gitnexus` globally. The build now bundles shared code into `dist/_shared/` and rewrites imports to relative paths (#613)
- **v1.5.1 publish regression** — npm's `prepare` lifecycle ran `tsc` after `prepack`, overwriting the rewritten imports before packing; both scripts now run the full build so the final tarball is always correct

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-01 [YANKED]

### Fixed
- Incomplete fix for `gitnexus-shared` bundling — `prepare` script overwrote rewritten imports during publish

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Repo landing screen** — when the backend detects indexed repositories, the web UI now shows a landing page with selectable repo cards (name, stats, indexed date) instead of auto-loading the first repo; users can also analyze new repos directly from the landing screen (#607)
- **Unified web & CLI ingestion pipeline** — complete architectural migration of the web app from a self-contained WASM browser app to a thin client backed by the CLI server; new `gitnexus-shared` package for cross-package type unification (#536)
  - New server endpoints: `/api/heartbeat` (SSE liveness), `/api/info`, `/api/repos`, `/api/file`, `/api/grep`, `/api/analyze` (SSE progress), `/api/embed`, `/api/mcp` (MCP-over-StreamableHTTP)
  - Onboarding flow: auto-detect server → connect → repo landing or analyze
  - Header repo dropdown: switch, re-analyze, or delete repos
- **Azure OpenAI support for wiki command** — fixed broken Azure auth (`api-key` header), `api-version` URL parameter, reasoning model handling (`max_completion_tokens`, no `temperature`), content filter error messages; added interactive setup wizard, `--api-version` and `--reasoning-model` CLI flags (#562)
- **Java method references & interface dispatch** — `obj::method` treated as call sites, overload selection via typed variable args (not just literals), interface dispatch emits additional CALLS edges to implementing classes (#540)
- **MethodExtractor abstraction** — structured method metadata extraction (isAbstract, isFinal, annotations, visibility, parameter types) with config-driven factory pattern (#576)
  - Java and Kotlin configs with overload-safe `methodInfoCache` keyed by `name:line`
  - C# config with `sealed`, `params`/`out`/`ref`/optional parameters, `[Attribute]` syntax, `internal` visibility (#582)
- **`--skip-agents-md` CLI flag** — opt out of overwriting GitNexus-managed sections in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md during `gitnexus analyze` (#517)
- **Prettier** — monorepo-wide code formatter with lint-staged + Husky pre-commit hook, `.prettierrc` config, Tailwind CSS v4 plugin, `endOfLine: "lf"` + `.gitattributes` for Windows consistency (#563)
- **ESLint v9** — flat config with `unused-imports` auto-removal, `@typescript-eslint` rules, React hooks rules, CI `lint` job (#564)

### Fixed
- **OpenCode MCP configuration** — corrected README MCP setup for OpenCode which requires `command` as an array containing both executable and arguments (#363)
- **litellm security** — excluded vulnerable versions 1.82.7 and 1.82.8 in eval harness `pyproject.toml` (#580)

### Changed
- **Reduced explicit `any` types** — 128 `no-explicit-any` warnings eliminated (689 → 561, 19% reduction) across `NodeProperties` index signature, ~80 `SyntaxNode` substitutions, typed worker protocol, and graphology community detection (#566)

### Docs
- Added `gitnexus-shared` build step to web UI quick start instructions (#585)
- Added enterprise offering section to README (#579)

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

  - Downgrade tree-sitter from ^0.25.0 to ^0.21.1 (only npm version where all 14 parsers agree)
  - Align all parser versions to their highest ^0.21.x-compatible releases
  - Remove tree-sitter override (only applies to root packages, ignored by npx)
  - Pin tree-sitter-dart to correct ABI-14-compatible commit
  - Exact pins for tree-sitter-c (0.23.2), tree-sitter-python (0.23.4), tree-sitter-rust (0.23.1) where next patch requires ^0.22.x

## [1.4.9] - 2026-03-26

- **Dart language support** — tree-sitter grammar, type extractors, import/call resolution, Flutter/Riverpod framework detection (#204)
- **Field type extraction** — Phase 8 & 9: per-language field extractors with generic table-driven factory + TypeScript hand-written extractor, return-type binding in call-processor (#494)
  - 14 language configs (TS/JS, Python, Go, Rust, C/C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Dart)

- **Phase 9 return-type variable binding** — call-result variable binding across 11 languages (#379)
  - `extractPendingAssignment` in per-language type extractors captures `let x = getUser()` patterns
  - Unified fixpoint loop resolves variable types from function return types after initial walk
  - Field access on call-result variables: `user.name` resolves `name` via return type's class definition
  - Method-call-result chaining: `user.getProfile().bio` resolves through intermediate return types
  - 22 new test fixtures covering call-result and method-chain binding across all supported languages
  - Integration tests added for all 10 language resolver suites
- **ACCESSES edge type** with read/write field access tracking (#372)
- **Python `enumerate()` for-loop support** with nested tuple patterns (#356)
- **MCP tool/resource descriptions** updated to reflect Phase 9 ACCESSES edge semantics and `declaredType` property

### Fixed
- **mcp**: server crashes under parallel tool calls (#326, #349)
- **parsing**: undefined error on languages missing from call routers (#364)
- **web**: add missing Kotlin entries to `Record<SupportedLanguages>` maps
- **rust**: `await` expression unwrapping in `extractPendingAssignment` for async call-result binding
- **tests**: update property edge and write access expectations across multiple language tests
- **docs**: corrected stale "single-pass" claims in type-resolution-system.md to reflect walk+fixpoint architecture

### Changed
- **Upgrade `@ladybugdb/core` to 0.15.2** and remove segfault workarounds (#374)
- **type-resolution-roadmap.md** overhauled — completed phases condensed to summaries, Phases 10–14 added with full engineering specs

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Phase 7 type resolution** — return-aware loop inference for call-expression iterables (#341)
  - `ReturnTypeLookup` interface with `lookupReturnType` / `lookupRawReturnType` split
  - `ForLoopExtractorContext` context object replacing positional `(node, env)` signature
  - Call-expression iterable resolution across 8 languages (TS/JS, Java, Kotlin, C#, Go, Rust, Python, PHP)
  - PHP `$this->property` foreach via `@var` class property scan (Strategy C)
  - PHP `function_call_expression` and `member_call_expression` foreach paths
  - `extractElementTypeFromString` as canonical raw-string container unwrapper in `shared.ts`
  - `extractReturnTypeName` deduplicated from `call-processor.ts` into `shared.ts` (137 lines removed)
  - `SKIP_SUBTREE_TYPES` performance optimization with documented `template_string` exclusion
  - `pendingCallResults` infrastructure (dormant — Phase 9 work)

### Fixed
- **impact**: return structured error + partial results instead of crashing (#345)
- **impact**: add `HAS_METHOD` and `OVERRIDES` to `VALID_RELATION_TYPES` (#350)
- **cli**: write tool output to stdout via fd 1 instead of stderr (#346)
- **postinstall**: add permission fix for CLI and hook scripts (#348)
- **workflow**: use prefixed temporary branch name for fork PRs to prevent overwriting real branches
- **test**: add `--repo` to CLI e2e tool tests for multi-repo environment
- **php**: add `declaration_list` type guard on `findClassPropertyElementType` fallback
- **docs**: correct `pendingCallResults` description in roadmap and system docs

### Chore
- Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Ruby language support** for CLI and web (#111)
- **TypeEnvironment API** with constructor inference, self/this/super resolution (#274)
- **Return type inference** with doc-comment parsing (JSDoc, PHPDoc, YARD) and per-language type extractors (#284)
- **Phase 4 type resolution** — nullable unwrapping, for-loop typing, assignment chain propagation (#310)
- **Phase 5 type resolution** — chained calls, pattern matching, class-as-receiver (#315)
- **Phase 6 type resolution** — for-loop Tier 1c, pattern matching, container descriptors, 10-language coverage (#318)
  - Container descriptor table for generic type argument resolution (Map keys vs values)
  - Method-aware for-loop extractors with integration tests for all languages
  - Recursive pattern binding (C# `is` patterns, Kotlin `when/is` smart casts)
  - Class field declaration unwrapping for C#/Java
  - PHP `$this->property` foreach member access
  - C++ pointer dereference range-for
  - Java `this.data.values()` field access patterns
  - Position-indexed when/is bindings for branch-local narrowing
- **Type resolution system documentation** with architecture guide and roadmap
- `.gitignore` and `.gitnexusignore` support during file discovery (#231)
- Codex MCP configuration documentation in README (#236)
- `skipGraphPhases` pipeline option to skip MRO/community/process phases for faster test runs
- `hookTimeout: 120000` in vitest config for CI beforeAll hooks

### Changed
- **Migrated from KuzuDB to LadybugDB v0.15** (#275)
- Dynamically discover and install agent skills in CLI (#270)

### Performance
- Worker pool threshold — skip worker creation for small repos (<15 files or <512KB total)
- AST walk pruning via `SKIP_SUBTREE_TYPES` for leaf-only nodes (string, comment, number literals)
- Pre-computed `interestingNodeTypes` set — single Set.has() replaces 3 checks per AST node
- `fastStripNullable` — skip full nullable parsing for simple identifiers (90%+ case)
- Replace `.children?.find()` with manual for loops in `extractFunctionName` to eliminate array allocations

### Fixed
- Same-directory Python import resolution (#328)
- Ruby method-level call resolution, HAS_METHOD edges, and dispatch table (#278)
- C++ fixture file casing for case-sensitive CI
- Template string incorrectly included in AST pruning set (contains interpolated expressions)
